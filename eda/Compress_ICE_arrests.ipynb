It checks that it has not previously processed data for this date before by checking a list of dates that it adds to whenever it processes an apprehension date for the first time. If it has not processed data relating to this date before, it finds the indices of arrests on that day in the cleaned ICE data. It then finds the total number of arrests, arrests leading to a deportation, the total numbers of arrests leading to deportations that either deport to the deported persons' country of citizenship or not, and the proportion of deportation-resulting arrests that go to the deported persons' coubtry of citizenship. It adds these to lists that will become columns of the daily_df dataframe afterwards."
