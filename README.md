# ICE-CMPU250
Drawing on data published by https://deportationdata.org/data/ice.html spanning 2011-2025 as an agglutination from multiple FOIA requests, how do ICE arrests, deportations, and other encounters change over time? Are there trends that align with presidential administrations? What are the racial and gendered leanings in the data? What times of day are ICE arrests more common, in what areas, and during what years?

In this project we intend to explore in-depth both recent and older data releases from Immigrations & Customs Enforcement from an explicitly anti-ICE perspective, putting the data releases in a critical context in which we question the efficacy and purpose of ICE as an institution, as well as questioning the *quality of data* that we interact with.

Methedology outline
---
We intend to focus on a handful of outcome variables: 
- Mismatches of deportation country & citizenship country (over time and by AOR)
- Numbers of arrests (by presidential administration, by time, by state, by gender, by age, and by AOR)
- Correlation between deportation, criminality, reported race, and reported ethnicity

We hope that through observations of these relationships, we can demonstrate (or refute) certain popular narratives about ICE & immigration. For example, one common justification for ICE is the presumed criminality of undocumented immigrants. By using the least charitable variable possible to individuals arrested by ICE (the worst crime they have ever been *accused* of), we can compare these data against publicly available demographic data for arrests and convictions made by municipal police, and demonstrate whether such claims hold any credibility. 
All these planned observations will require comparison against publicly available data of other sorts, such as policy and budget changes to ICE over time and intersectional criminalization statistics.

One other type of claim that we can evaluate through this dataset is claims often made about the behavior of ICE: Where do they tend to operate, and between what hours? Data such as this can be helpful to groups seeking to protect community members from ICE, and can be vital in promoting the safety of immigrants (both documented & undocumented) in light of the recent SCOTUS decision regarding ICE & racial profiling, the beginning politcal deployment of ICE (for example, what is currently happening to Khalil), and July's "Big Beautiful Bill" which allocates an additional $75 Billion to ICE's budget over the next four years.

This is an actively updating project.
