# ICE-CMPU250
Drawing on data published by https://deportationdata.org/data/ice.html spanning 2011-2025 as an agglutination from multiple FOIA requests, how do ICE arrests, deportations, and other encounters change over time? Are there trends that align with presidential administrations? What are the racial and gendered leanings in the data? What times of day are ICE arrests more common, in what areas, and during what years?

In this project we intend to explore in-depth both recent and older data releases from Immigrations & Customs Enforcement from an explicitly anti-ICE perspective, putting the data releases in a critical context in which we question the efficacy and purpose of ICE as an institution, as well as questioning the *quality of data* that we interact with.

This is an actively updating project.
