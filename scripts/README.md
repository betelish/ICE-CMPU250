Here be scripts!
=========
A catalogue of all scripts used in the course of this project

Unfortunately, dataframe table styles seem to not properly display within the github preview, so the wonderful colours in these script don't display adiquitely. 
To see the file in all its glory, please open it in Jupyter Notebook (or, presumably, Google Colab)

Regarding cleaned data & the exploratory data analysis:
As these datasets are truely immense (2023-2025 taking up nearly 300,000 entries and the full 2011-2025 set comming in at a whopping ~1.7 *million*), exploratory data analysis & relevant figures were created using the pre-cleaned 2023-2025 arrest dataset. The file created by the cleaner script is *not* the dataset used for EDA, but it will be the file primarily used going forward.
